# yams
Yet another monitoring service...

Why do we need another monitoring service?
YAMS was built to run on as many Linux based operating machines, as quickly as possible.  Using BASH and CURL, as well as pretty widespread common binaries for collecting data, you can gather information about your servers from just a single script.


The list of binaries it uses are below:
- bash
- which
- echo
- hash
- dmidecode [optional]
- awk
- uniq
- sed
- uname
- cat
- lsb_release [optional]
- free
- grep
- df
- ip addr
- netstat
- mysql [optional]
